===============

You can use this app to study the relationships among the variables that constitute the mtcars dataset.
In order to do this there's a list of checkboxes on the left you can select or deeselect, and the algorithms implemented consequently change.
Above the checkboxes you can see the formula for the linear regression you're trying to test, if you select or deselect a variable that variable will appear or disappear from the formula.
On the right side of the application you can see the results of the linear regression, with the various results, means, p-values, etc. Below that there's a set of graphs that compare the mpg variable (miles per unit of gallon) with the other ones.
The ones not factorized appear as boxplots, the ones that are not appear as simple graphs with the linear regression line.
Below this graph there's the residual plot for the selected formula.
