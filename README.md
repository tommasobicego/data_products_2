Linear Regression: Miles/(US) gallon vs ...
===============

Tommaso Bicego, Milano - Italia, 10/08/2014

You can use this app to study the relationships among the variables that constitute the mtcars dataset.
In order to do this there's a list of checkboxes on the left you can select or deselect, the algorithms implemented consequently change depending on the variables you want to add to the formula.
As the title already says the comparison is between the **mpg** variable and the rest.

Above the checkboxes you can see the formula that describes the linear regression you're trying to test, the selected variables will appear or disappear depending on your selections.

On the right there are the results of the linear regression you've chosen (means, p-values, etc.).

Below there's a set of graphs, every picture compares the mpg variable (miles per unit of gallon) with one of the specified variables.

As you can see from the picture the behaviours of the factorized variables appear as *boxplot* plots, the ones that are not, instead, as simple graphs, and they're fitted by the relative linear regression line.

Below these graphs there's the residual plot for the chosen formula.
